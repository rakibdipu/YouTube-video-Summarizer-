NEO 6M GPS Module is perfect for tracking vehicles, logging locations, or even sending a drone on an adventure. At the heart of the module is a GPS chip from Ublox, the NEO6M. This powerful chip can track up to 22 satellites and handle up to 50 tracking channels simultaneously. The NEO6M GPS module has a 4KB HK24C32 EPROM chip and a small rechargeable button battery. The module uses about 45 mA of current during the normal operation. It also has a feature called Power Save Mode, which lets it turn off parts of the chip when they're not needed.
